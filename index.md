### Welcome!
You have landed on the personal website of Anran Chen, a scientist at the intersection of cancer molecular biology, technology, and entrepreneurship.

- Senior Scientist in oncology discovery at Bayer (OTCMKTS: BAYRY) and former Senior Scientist in bioinformatics at Repare Therapeutics (NASDAQ: RPTX). I use data, biology, and strategic thinking to pinpoint novel targets for cancer treatment.
- BA in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge and PhD in Molecular and Biomedical Sciences from Baylor College of Medicine. My PhD research focused on understanding the resistance mechanisms in ER+ breast cancer. One of my work is recently featured at [BCM news](https://www.bcm.edu/news/pkmyt1-a-potential-achilles-heel-of-treatment-resistant-er-breast-cancers-with-the-poorest-prognosis){:target="_blank"}!
- Avid explorer for state-of-the-art AI models such as GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion. Fun fact: all images on this site are generated or improved by AIs!
- Enthusiast for studying how technology and science shape the future of investment and business. (Yes, I passed the CFA Level I exam in November 2024)
- Team-worker and leader who have organized and hosted various events. I currently co-lead the Boston Chapter of  CAMentrepreneur, an inclusive Cambridge University alumni network dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship. Join us by connecting through our [LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13026165/){:target="_blank"}.
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anran-chen-ph-d-6386a5a9/){:target="_blank"} to discuss science, innovation, and entrepreneurship, or find my publications on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anran-Chen-6){:target="_blank"}.
